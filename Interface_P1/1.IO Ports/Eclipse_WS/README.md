## Exercise-1
<p>1.connect pin3 PortA with push button using Pull up resistor</p>
<p>2.connect led with pin7 PortC using positive logic </p>
<p>Turn on led when push button is pressed</p>
<p>Turn off led when push button is released</p>

## Exercise-2
<p>1.connect led to pin6 PortD </p>
<p>2.connect led with negaive logic </p>
<p>3.make led toggle every 1 second</p>

## Exercise-3
<p>connect push button 1 & 2 to pin 0 & 1 in PORTB</p>
<p>use pull down resistor in push button connection</p>
<p>connect led 1 & 2 to pin 0 & 1 in PORTC</p>
<p>use positive logic in Led connection</p>
<p>if button 1 pressed turn led 1 on only and if button 2 pressed turn led 2 on only</p>
<p>in case two button pressed turn two led on</p>
<p>in case no button pressed trun two led off</p>

## Exercise-3
<p>Connect switch to Pin 0 in PORTB using Internal Pull up  resistor</p>
<p>connect led to pin 0 PORTC using negative logic</p>
<p>if button pressed toggle Led every New press</p>

## Challenge-1
<p>Connect 8 leds to PORTC using Positive logic</p>
<p>make roll action as led1 only turn on then next one and last off then next one until led8 and return from begin at led1</p>
