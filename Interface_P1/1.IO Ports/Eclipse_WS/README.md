## Exercise-1
<p>1.connect pin3 PortA with push button using Pull up resistor</p>
<p>2.connect led with pin7 PortC using positive logic </p>
<p>Turn on led when push button is pressed</p>
<p>Turn off led when push button is released</p>

## Exercise-2
<p>1.connect led to pin6 PortD </p>
<p>2.connect led with negaive logic </p>
<p>3.make led toggle every 1 second</p>

## Exercise-3
<p>connect push button 1 & 2 to pin 0 & 1 in PORTB</p>
<p>use pull down resistor in push button connection</p>
<p>connect led 1 & 2 to pin 0 & 1 in PORTC</p>
<p>use positive logic in Led connection</p>
<p>if button 1 pressed turn led 1 on only and if button 2 pressed turn led 2 on only</p>
<p>in case two button pressed turn two led on</p>
<p>in case no button pressed trun two led off</p>

## Exercise-3
<p>Connect switch to Pin 0 in PORTB using Internal Pull up  resistor</p>
<p>connect led to pin 0 PORTC using negative logic</p>
<p>if button pressed toggle Led every New press</p>

## Challenge-1
<p>Connect 8 leds to PORTC using Positive logic</p>
<p>make roll action as led1 only turn on then next one and last off then next one until led8 and return from begin at led1</p>

## Challenge-2
<p>connect push button 1 7 2 to pin 3 & 4 in PORTA using  PULL Down connection</p>
<p>Connect all pins of PORTD to leds using Positive logic</p>
<p>If (B1) or (B1 & B2) pressed only make even leds blink every half second</p>
<p>If B2 pressed only make odd leds blink every half second</p>

## Exercise-5
<p>connect pin 4 in PORTD to push button using pull down</p>
<p>7-segment common anode connect to first 4 pins in PORTC </p>
<p>if switch pressed increase number appear in 7-seg until max then make overflow</p>

## Challenge-3
<p>Connect two push button to pin 0 & 1 in PORTA using pull down </p>
<p>Connect 7-seg common anode to first 4 pins of PORTD </p>
<p>if B1 pressed increase number displayed in 7-seg and if number reach maximum do nothing</p>
<p>if B2 pressed decrease number displayed in 7-seg and if number reach minimum do nothing</p>

## Challenge-4
<p>Connect Pin 0 in PORTC to PIR sensor as this pin is input pin</p>
<p>Connect pin 0 in PORTB to LED using positive logic</p>
<p>turn on led when motion is detected uding PIR otherwise turn off</p>
