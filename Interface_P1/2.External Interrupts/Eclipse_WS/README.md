# Explain prolems for exercises and challenges
- [Exercise-1](#Exercise-1)
- [Exercise-2](#Exercise-2)

## Exercise-1
<p>1.connect pin0 PortC with led using Negative logic</p>
<p>2.connect Push button with pin2 PortD at INT0 using pull down </p>
<p>when INT0 triggered toggle led</p>

## Exercise-2
<p>Connect all pins of PORTC to leds using Positive logic and set as output pins</p>
<p>connect Button to pin 3 in PORTD as use this pin for external interrupt and configure pin to input pin and enable pull up resistor</p>
<p>make roll action as first pin only high for half second then second pin only high for half second until pin 7 and repeat it again </p>
<p>when INT1 triggered all leds flash five times in five seconds</p>
