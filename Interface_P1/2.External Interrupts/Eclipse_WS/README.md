## Exercise-1
<p>1.connect pin0 PortC with led using Negative logic</p>
<p>2.connect Push button with pin2 PortD at INT0 using pull down </p>
<p>when INT0 triggered toggle led</p>

## Exercise-2
<p>Connect all pins of PORTC to leds using Positive logic and set as output pins</p>
<p>connect Button to pin 3 in PORTD as use this pin for external interrupt and configure pin to input pin and enable pull up resistor</p>
<p>make roll action as first pin only high for half second then second pin only high for half second until pin 7 and repeat it again </p>
<p>when INT1 triggered all leds flash five times in five seconds</p>


## Challenge-1
<p>connect 7447 to first 4 pins in portC  which is connected to 7 segment common anode</p>
<p>connect Button to INT2 with pull down resistor</p>
<p>when interrupt triggered increament 7-segment until number 9 and make overflow and return to 0</p>

## Exercise-3
<p>Apply nesting interrupt in AVR </p>
<p>Connect all pins in portA to leds using positive logic  </p>
<p>Connect first four pins in portB to leds using positive logic </p>
<p>Connect pin 0 in portC to led using positive logic</p>
<p>make led connected to pin 0 in PORTC toggle every half second</p>
<p>connect Button to EXT INT0 and button to EXT INT1 using Pull down resistor</p>
<p>when INT0 triggered turn one led from 4 leds for 1.5second </p>
<p>when INT1 triggered turn one led from 8 leds for 1 second</p>
