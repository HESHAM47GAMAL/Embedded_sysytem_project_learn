## Exercise-1
<p>Configure MCU clock </p>
<p>Connect Pin 0 in PORTC and pin 0 in PORTA to led using positive logic </p>
<p>Use Timer0 to generate time Delay as toggle led for every half second using Normal mode</p>
<p>Use Polling Technique</p>


## Exercise-2
<p>Configure MCU clock </p>
<p>Connect Pin 0 in PORTC and pin 0 in PORTA to led using positive logic </p>
<p>Use Timer0 to generate time Delay as toggle led for every half second using Normal mode</p>
<p>Use Interrupt Technique</p>

## Challenge-1
<p>Configure PORTD as output port and connect 7-segment commen cathode </p>
<p>Every one second increament 7-segment until reach 9 then make overflow </p>
<p>Use timer0 in overflow mode </p>

## Exercise-3
<p>Configure MCU clock I work with 8 MHZ</p>
<p>Connect Pin 0 in PORTC and pin 0 in PORTA to led using positive logic </p>
<p>Use Timer0 to generate time Delay as toggle led for every half second using Normal mode</p>
<p>Use Interrupt Technique</p>

## Exercise-4
<p>configure MCU clock to 1 MHZ</p>
<p>use CTC mode to generate Waveform with 2 KHZ clock using same MCu clock (prescaler 1)</p>
<p>Duty cycle 50 %</p>

## Challenge-2
<p>configure MCU clock to 8 MHZ</p>
<p>use CTC mode to generate WaveForms using (prescaler 8)</p>
<p>configure first 3 pins in PORTC to drive out this signals </p>
<p>First wave with 10KHZ  , Second wave with 5KHZ , third wave with 2.5KHZ</p>
<p>Duty cycle 50 %</p>
