## Exercise-1
<p>Configure MCU clock </p>
<p>Connect Pin 0 in PORTC and pin 0 in PORTA to led using positive logic </p>
<p>Use Timer0 to generate time Delay as toggle led for every half second using Normal mode</p>
<p>Use Polling Technique</p>


## Exercise-2
<p>Configure MCU clock </p>
<p>Connect Pin 0 in PORTC and pin 0 in PORTA to led using positive logic </p>
<p>Use Timer0 to generate time Delay as toggle led for every half second using Normal mode</p>
<p>Use Interrupt Technique</p>

## Challenge-1
<p>Configure PORTD as output port and connect 7-segment commen cathode </p>
<p>Every one second increament 7-segment until reach 9 then make overflow </p>
<p>Use timer0 in overflow mode </p>
