# Explain prolems for exercises and challenges
- [Exercise-1](#Exercise-1)
- [Exercise-2](#Exercise-2)

## Exercise-1
<p>Connect MCU with clock 8Mhz</p>
<p>Conncet MCu to USB to TTl</p>
<p>You will transmit from MCU to PC through USB to TTL</p>
<p>Configure MCU to work Asynchronous with  baud rate = 9600</p>
<p>first thing clear screen then return to home position then send message "Message from ATmega32"</p>
<p>⛔⚠️Note clear terminal screen and return to home not work in simulation</p>



## Exercise-2
<p>Connect MCU1 & MCU2 with clock 8Mhz</p>
<p>Connect MCU1 to Keypad with PORTA using internal Pull up resistor</p>
<p>Connect MCU2 to 8leds using Positive logic at PortC</p>
<p>MCU1 will send to MCU2</p>
<p>Catch keypad press and any number between 0 to 7 send to MCU2 and corresponding led turn on</p>
