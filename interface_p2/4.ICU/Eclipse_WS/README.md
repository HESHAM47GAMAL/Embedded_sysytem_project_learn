# Explain prolems for exercises and challenges
- [Exercise-1](#Exercise-1)


## Exercise-1
<p>Connect LCD to PORTA using 4 bit data line</p>
<p>connect RS to pin 0 in PORTC</p>
<p>connect RW to pin 1 in PORTC</p>
<p>connect E to pin 6 in PORTC</p>
<p>Connect Led to OC0 (PB3) as use T0 to generate Phase Correct PWM </p>
<p>Connect push button to External interrupt (INT0) as used to increase duty cycle of PWM and configure this pin as input pull up</p>
<p>Connect push button to External interrupt (INT1) as used to decrease duty cycle of PWM and configure this pin as input pull up</p>
<p>connect OC0 (PB3) to ICP1 (PD6) pin and use Timer 1 as ICU as always calculate Duty cycle and print it in LCD</p>
