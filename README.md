## Description
<P>Here I Implement exercise using built in and my own drivers to learn Embedded system and this done in course Eng Mohamed Tarek and Do Some exercise from another courses and most of them I make small video to show it in hardware implement(check this videos attached in readme for proteus simulation)</P>

## Content 
<p>Here will upload Exercise and Challenges to learn  Embedded System and consist of two parts </p>

### Interface-P1
<p>Here mostly all of exercise and challenges written by built in drivers</p>

### Interface-P2
<p>Here mostly all of exercise and challenges are depend on my drivers impelementation</p>

## Note
<p>If you use Eclipse avr plugin always deal that MCU ATmega16 and I use ATmega32 I know that almost main difference is Memory but during build process deal that MCU is ATmega16 and when use ATmega32 in proteus or real life make some unexpected behavior </p>
<p>Case that take my attension in first that EXT INT2 not work in real Hardware or simulation when I use ATmega32 but use eclipse that build project for ATmega16 </p>
<p>I try to edit this But I failed so I build project using <strong>Microchip Studio</strong> </p>
